# DhikrApp

This my first try to develop an App for the muslim community. I really don't enjoy the traditional way and was thinking if there is a better solution and there is.
Mainly I focus on the development on Android because of the low fee to get started.
Dhikr is really important for muslims and you get rewards for that. But sometimes people forget on how many they should say and which phrases have what benefit.
